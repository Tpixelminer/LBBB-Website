# LBBB-Website
This is my LBBB creative project website! Now open Source!
This project was made when I was assigned to make a creative project based off of the book Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy. I went through many ideas until I came up with this one to make a site about the book in general. The general website structure is there is a main screen and it has a nav bars with links taking you to different areas of the site.
I hope you enjoy and remember that this is licenced under the Apache licence 2.0. :)
